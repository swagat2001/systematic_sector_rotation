### Useful Diagnostic Scripts (Optional - Keep if Useful)

- `verify_system.py` - System health check

## How to Clean Up

### Option 1: Manual Deletion (Safest)

Review each file, then delete manually:

```bash
# Review first
cat cleanup_project.py

# Delete if sure
rm cleanup_project.py
```

### Option 2: Automated Deletion (Use with Caution)

Run the safe cleanup script:

```bash
python safe_cleanup.py
```

This will:
1. Show files to delete
2. Create backup
3. Ask for confirmation
4. Delete files

### Option 3: Do Nothing

These files don't hurt anything. You can keep them if you want future reference.

## Space Saved

Deleting obsolete files will free up approximately:
- Scripts: ~50 KB
- Documentation: ~100 KB
- **Total: ~150 KB** (negligible)

The real space is in `NSE_sector_wise_data/nse_cash.db` (180 MB) which is **ESSENTIAL** - never delete!

## Recommendation

**Safe approach:**
1. Review each file in the "Safe to Delete" list
2. Delete only if you're sure you don't need it
3. Keep all diagnostic scripts for now (useful for troubleshooting)
4. Keep all current documentation

**Aggressive approach:**
1. Run `python safe_cleanup.py`
2. Choose to create backup
3. Confirm deletion
4. Test system still works

## After Cleanup

Verify system still works:

```bash
# 1. Check imports
python -c "from strategy.dual_approach_portfolio import DualApproachPortfolioManager; print('✓ OK')"

# 2. Run quick test
python debug_orders_simple.py

# 3. Launch dashboard
streamlit run dashboard/streamlit_app.py
```

All should work perfectly!

**Note:** This cleanup is OPTIONAL. The system works perfectly as-is. Clean up only if you want a tidier directory structure.
